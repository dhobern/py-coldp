title: Global Lepidoptera Index
alias: Global Lepidoptera Index
description: "Global Lepidoptera Index is a revised dataset based on the Global Lepidoptera\
  \ Names Index (LepIndex), a digitised and updated version of the unique index card\
  \ archive to the scientific names of the living and fossil butterflies and moths\
  \ of the world at the Natural History Museum (London). This card index was produced\
  \ by the museumâ€™s lepidopterists over many decades and contained 15,578 genus and\
  \ 157,474 species names for Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies), together with synonyms,\
  \ misspellings and misidentifications. Updates to LepIndex, the digitised version\
  \ of this dataset, ended in 2012. Large sections of the dataset are outdated and\
  \ contain errors or inaccuracies (particularly relating to changes in higher classification\
  \ and incomplete data on historical combinations for each epithet), but the size\
  \ of the Lepidoptera makes it challenging to find and correct all these issues.\n\
  \nLepIndex has now been imported into TaxonWorks and is maintained there as an online\
  \ curated resource. Significant updates have been made to some families, and work\
  \ will continue to improve all aspects of this important dataset. \n\nTaxonomists\
  \ working with any Lepidoptera groups are encouraged to make contributions to improve\
  \ the quality and completeness of the dataset. Please contact Donald Hobern (donald.hobern@sp2000.org)\
  \ for more information."
