Usage
=====

The following example illustrates basic usage. It creates a new COLDP
instance for the monotypic Lepidoptera family Tridentaformidae, including
name and taxon records for the family, genus and species, the original 
combination for the species, three distribution records for the species, and
references for all elements.

Running the same code a second time leaves the data unchanged since it 
locates and validates the existing records.

In this example, each reference is associated with an ID string provided
when the records are created, but all name and taxon ID strings are 
generated and managed by the COLDP instance.

Adding the synonym to the NameBundle for the species enables the COLDP instance
to create the relevant basionymID reference to the current combination.

The example names include a mixture with parsed name elements or a single
scientificName element. The final names table includes both formats for all
names.

The addition of the distribution records shows the pattern for adding other
COLDP classes that reference name (namerelation, typematerial) and taxon 
(distribution, speciesinteraction) records.
